### Abstract

We study convective stability of a two-front superposition in a reaction-diffusion system. Due to the instability of the connecting equilibrium, long-range semi-strong interaction is expected between the two waves. When restricting to the linear dynamic, we indeed identify that convective stability of superposed waves occurs for fewer propagation speeds than for the corresponding single waves. It reflects the interaction that monostable waves have over long distances. Our method relies on numerical range estimates, that imply time-uniform resolvent bounds.
